# PWA - Text Editor - JUST ANOTHER TEXT EDITOR

## Description
A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application that offers offline functionality, push notifications, and the ability to download onto a users's homescreen like a native app. PWA's are designed to be reliable and fast which are needed for in certain cases where you need to run an app on a browser without internet access. In this instance, a PWA was used to create a text editor that user's can not only install onto their computers but make use of their web browser's storage to contain any information entered during periods with no internet. This allows for a seamless web browser text editor experience to users. To access this browser storage, IndexedDB will be used since it is an API for client-side storage that will store and retrieve data. An idb package will be used to wrap around the IndexedDB API and the entire project is run on Heroku.

When I first started this project I had no real clue what a PWA was, but after going through the all the steps and breaking down eahc component as the assignment went on allowed me to finally get the bigger picture of what all PWA's can do. It's so cool to have an application that I can use when I don't have internet on my laptop that essebtially is like a notes app, but WAY cooler!
